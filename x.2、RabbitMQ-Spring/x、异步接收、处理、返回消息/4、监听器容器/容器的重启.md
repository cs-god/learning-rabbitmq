When a container is configured to listen to `auto-delete` queues, the queue has an `x-expires` option, or the Time-To-Live policy is configured on the Broker, the queue is removed by the broker when the container is stopped (that is, when the last consumer is cancelled). Before version 1.3, the container could not be restarted because the queue was missing. The RabbitAdmin only automatically redeclares queues and so on when the connection is closed or when it opens, which does not happen when the container is stopped and started. Starting with version 1.3, the container uses a RabbitAdmin to redeclare any missing queues during startup. You can also use conditional declaration (see Conditional Declaration) together with an autostartup="false" admin to defer queue declaration until the container is started. The following example shows how to do so:
```xml
<rabbit:queue id="otherAnon" declared-by="containerAdmin" /> 
<rabbit:direct-exchange name="otherExchange" auto-delete="true" declared-by= "containerAdmin">   
	<rabbit:bindings>   
		<rabbit:binding queue="otherAnon" key="otherAnon" />   
	</rabbit:bindings> 
</rabbit:direct-exchange>
<rabbit:listener-container id="container2" auto-startup="false"> 
	<rabbit:listener id="listener2" ref="foo" queues="otherAnon" admin= "containerAdmin" />
</rabbit:listener-container>

<rabbit:admin id="containerAdmin" connection-factory="rabbitConnectionFactory" auto-startup="false" />
```
